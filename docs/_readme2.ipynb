    "Python-first access to battle-tested **R/Bioconductor differential expression** tooling — without giving up modern Python data workflows.\n",

    "- you work in Python\n",
    "- your data already lives in a Bioconductor-like container\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two main setups:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Conda environment (recommended)\n",
    "Use the provided `environment.yaml` to get Python, R, `rpy2`, and required R packages in one reproducible environment.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) System R\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer a system-installed R (instead of conda R), make sure your R setup is compatible with rpy2 and required Bioconductor packages are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then install the package with pip:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install \"deferential_expression @ git+https://github.com/MaximilianNuber/deferential_expression.git@main\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the R-functions are used, `deferential_expression`automatically checks if required R-packages are installed, and installs if necessary."
